    iQuHACK (interdisciplinary Quantum HACKathon) is MIT's first annual quantum hackathon.
    We aim to bring people from a diverse set of backgrounds, including physics, computer science, chemistry, 
    and the arts together to explore improvements and applications of near-term quantum devices.
    As a part of iQuHACK, we are also hosting a workshop on Friday January 31st.
    The workshop is focused on the properties and applications of NISQ devices,
    and is aimed at preparing you for the hackathon.

    No need to have a background in quantum information! Along with IBM instructors, 
    we will teach you the basics of quantum circuits, algorithms and the types of projects 
    that can be done with IBM's <a href="https://qiskit.org/">Qiskit</a>.
    Your projects will be run on a <strong>real quantum computer</strong> hosted by
    <a href="https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/technology/experience/">IBM Q Experience</a>!
