    iQuHACK (interdisciplinary Quantum HACKathon) 2021 is MIT's second annual quantum hackathon.
    We aim to bring people from a diverse set of backgrounds, including physics, computer science, and chemistry,
    together to explore improvements and applications of near-term quantum devices.
    As a part of iQuHACK, we are also hosting a workshop on Friday, January 29th.
    The workshop is focused on the properties and applications of NISQ devices,
    and is aimed at preparing you for the hackathon.

    No need to have a background in quantum information! Coaches from our hardware sponsors will be available throughout the event, and 
    we will teach you the basics of quantum circuits, algorithms and the types of projects 
    that can be done with D-Wave's quantum annealing hardware or IonQ's trapped-ion quantum computing hardware.
    Your projects will be run on <strong>real quantum hardware</strong>!
